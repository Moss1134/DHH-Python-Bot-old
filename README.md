## What is DHH?
<p>
DHH stands for Discord Heal Hub, the name of our discord server! DHH is a place where people can talk to others about topics that are weighing them down.
</p>
<br>
<p>
DHH is seperated into Two major parts:
</p>

### Front-End

<p>On the front end we have the DHH Discord server! Of which the perma-link to join is; https://discord.gg/KdcnQhXf2H</p> <br>

> The current progress is not alot but we have the outlaying structure for the server ready!
> This is going to require much more work, however!
> I am currently the only one working on the front-end but I am looking for someone to take over the front-end entirely!

### Back-End

<p>The back end is represented in our Python bot!</p>

> I currently have the outlaying structure for the main part of DHH to slowly grow from
> This is at the early stages of development so don't expect too much!
> Unforunately the discord bot is running on my hardware currently so it's online time may vary or be very unstable.

## Running DHH Bot
> For this you can clone the GitHub and change the token varaible in the config file to the Token for your bot.
> I am more then happy for anyone to take my code and run with it as this is comepletely open-source!

# The Goal With DHH Bot

> The plan is to have a system where a user can sign up either as a Listener, or a Member for a time period.
> Members can make a request to connect to a Listner and the following will happen:
>   1. A new channel will be created
>   2. The Member and a Randomly picked Active Listener will be given access to this channel
>   3. The Member and Listener can talk about things
>   4. The Member or Listener can end the conversaion using a command
>   5. That channel will be deleted along with all of the messages in that channel
> This is what I hope to acheive at the end of this all.
